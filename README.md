##An anonymous, paged based message system

---
###How it works?

You create a page with and optional password. If a password was added, the password is required to view and post messages. If no password is on the page, it is public and anyone can access it.

###What's the point?
We wanted to create a place, that is completly anonymous, where you can post to the public about your interests, create a private message board, or even a personal page to post todos.

No personal information is stored on our servers. All we know is that this messages was posted to that page.

###Our Future
This was just a side project I started with a friend of mine. The site is currently down as I don't want to pay for it.
Will most likly stay this way.
